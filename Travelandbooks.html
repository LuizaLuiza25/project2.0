                                        <p>Over the past few years I have developed a tradition: every new country or town I visit, it is a must to find a local bookstore and buy a book. Yes, you could say books are my souvenirs. And I always try to find a book written by one of their national authors or - the action of the book to take place in that city or country. This is how I make and keep a small memory of the places I have visited. More so, everytime I miss travelling, I just pick up a book and dive myself in it. It works like magic: with the speed of light, in one split of a second, I can travel anywhere in this world. Not even the challenge of finding a place for my new books in my already crowded library does not stop me - after all, each book is an universe in itself and the pain is all worth it. Here are just some of the books I read in my travels. Naming them all would be a very long task.</p>

                                        <p>Greece has always been a fascinating country. Lovely people, amazing food, stunning beaches, with an extremely rich cultural and historical background. 
                                            ...and so, there is a looong looong list of books to read, when preparing to visit this wonderful country, but I will only mention a few.
                                             Whether you want to dive youself in their cultural heritage or just enjoy a day at the beach, reading about a legend that took place right there where you are now, here are some of my favourite books on Greek heritage: &quot;Ariadne&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot; by Jennifer Saint, &quot;Circe&quot; by Madeleine Miller, &quot;The Women of Troy&quot; by Pat Barker, &quot;A Thousand Ships&quot; by Natalie Haynes, the series wrote by Stephnen Fry - &quot;Mythos&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Troy&quot;.

                        <p>Ah, Italy! The home of Renaissance. And not only. A country rivaling with Greece when it comes to its delicious food, amazing landscapes, beautiful cities, an incredible cultural heritage and rich history. The homeplace of the most impressive empire of all times: the Roman Empire. Here to, there is a looong
                            list of travelling books to read - and so, sadly, I will have to limit myself to only a few. One of my favourites: &quot;Venice&quot; by Jan Morris - an excellent book to soothe the ocasional longing for Venice. Let's not forget the Donna Leon &quot;Commisario Brunetti&quot; series, or &quot;The Agony and Ecstasy&quot; by Irving Stone, all of Umberto Eco's books, the famous &quot;Decameron&quot; written by Boccaccio in the 14th century. The list can go on forever, with Dan Brown's books, or Elena Ferrante's the &quot;Neapolitan&quot; series, Stefania Auci's series about the Florio family of Sicily, the works of Marcus Aurelius, &quot;Meditation&quot;. These are just a few of the travelling books to read when missing or visiting Italy, and rest assure, there are many many more waiting out there to be discovered.</p>

                        <h2 class="Titles">...When in France</h2>
                        <p>...and here we are, in great France! The home of endless lavender fields, great history, incredible culture and astonishing Gothic cathedrals.
                            Home of pastis, great little medieval towns and villages, and one of world's most impressive literature. Oh la la!, I would say. Whenever I feel the need to escape a gray winter, I cozy up and read Peter Mayle's series &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;, but let's not forget about &Eacute;mile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas (father and son), Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, Moli&egrave;re, Marguerite Yourcenar, Jules Verne, George Sand, Voltaire, Stendhal - to name a few great authors. Fashion lover? Read Edmonde Charles-Roux's &quot;Coco Chanel&quot;, farytale seeker? Well, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry's &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is the book for you! Missing Paris? You should read Ernest Hemingway's &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;. As you can see, this can also become an endless list of great travelling books, a book for every taste there is out there. Still, my favourite past time reading will always be the Provence series by Peter Mayle.
